Late evening. There is a girl in a short skirt, a guy comes up to her and says in a hoarse voice:
- Hi, babe.
Girl:
- Hi...
guy:
- Come with me around the corner, I'll pour you some barberries!
The girl is blinking her eyes:
- Oh, is it true?
The guy winking:
- Really!
The guy wraps his arm around the girl and leads her around the corner. He stops, looks into the girl's eyes, pulls his hand out of his pocket and takes out a barbershop and says:
- Here, hold it!
Girl:
- That asshole! That's right, he spread it like that!
