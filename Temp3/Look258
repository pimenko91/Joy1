- Did you play cards, you bastards?
Soldiers:
- No way, Your Honor!
The officer asks the first soldier:
- Who are you?
That:
- Russian.
Officer:
- Swear on the Bible that you didn't play.
He:
- I swear.
The officer addresses the second soldier:
- And who are you?
The one:
- Tatar.
Officer:
- Swear on the Koran.
He:
- I swear.
Finally, it was the turn of the third. Officer:
- And who are you?
That:
- I'm Jewish.
Officer:
- Swear, you Jew's face, on the Talmud.
He:
- Your Honor! If he didn't play, and he didn't play, then who could I play with?
