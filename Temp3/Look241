The husband writes to his wife from a business trip:
- My love, this month I will not be able to send you money. But I'm worried and I'm sending you 60 kisses."
The wife responds with a report:
- The milkman agreed to 2 kisses for a bottle of milk a day.
- The electrician agreed to fix the wiring only after 7 kisses
- The owner of the house comes every day for his 3 kisses.
- The owner of the grocery store takes not only kisses, I had to give something else.
- Other expenses 40 kisses.
- Don't worry, I still have 35 kisses left before the end of the month.
- Plan the same thing for next month?
