The sultan once called his eunuch, and said:
- Bring my first wife to me.
The eunuch brought it. After a while, the sultan calls him again:
- Lead the second one.
He brought it back. Then the sultan demanded a third, a fifth, a tenth. In general, he drove the poor eunuch. By morning she calls him to her again:
- Bring the last one!
The eunuch tells the Sultan:
- Sultan, you're going to die soon!
Sultan:
- Why all of a sudden?
The Eunuch:
- From overwork. I'm tired of following your wives all night, and you're still there with them, like a baboon. The body will not withstand such loads for a long time!
Sultan:
- Remember, you can die from stupid running around, not from your favorite activity!
