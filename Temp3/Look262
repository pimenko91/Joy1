Astronauts at the Mir station, flying for the second year, are asked from the Ground:
- What should I send you with the cargo ship?
They answer:
- A woman. Any one. Inflatable, plastic, rubber. Any one!
They are responding from the Ground:
- Okay, we'll send it.
The Progress arrives, the astronauts begin to unload it in anticipation. At the very end, they find a box with the inscription "Liquid woman". They twist it in their hands for a long time, open it and take out a tube like toothpaste. Read the instructions for use:
- Squeeze 2-3 grams of "Liquid woman" into the palm of your hand and rub into your penis until you get an orgasm.
