A Somali immigrant in Hamburg stops a passerby and says:
- What wonderful people the Germans are. You allowed me to live in your country, gave me housing, money for food, free medical care, free education and no taxes!
A passerby:
- You made a mistake, I am an Afghan.
The Somali goes on and meets another passerby:
- Thank you for such a beautiful country Germany ...
He is not allowed to finish the sentence:
- I'm not German, I'm Iranian!
He goes on to the next passerby, shaking his hand and says:
- Thank you to your country Germany...
Again without finishing:
- I'm sorry, I'm Pakistani!
He goes on and meets a lady and asks:
- Tell me, are you German?
The lady answers:
- No, I'm from India!
The Somali is being probed:
- But where are all the Germans?
The Indian woman, looking at her watch, answers:
- All Germans are at work now!
