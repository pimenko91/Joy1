In court in a small American town, the prosecutor calls the first witness, an old grandmother. Begins the interrogation:
"Mrs. Jones, do you know me?"
Grandma is a witness:
"Of course I know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you since I was a little boy, and to be honest, you disappoint me a lot. You lie, cheat on your wife, manipulate people and say nasty things behind their backs. You think you're a big man because you don't have the brains to realize that you're just a petty bureaucrat.
The prosecutor was shocked. Not knowing what to do next, he pointed to the other side of the room and asked:
- Mrs. Jones, do you know a lawyer?
Grandma is a witness:
- Of course I know. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a kid. He is lazy, intolerant and has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law firm is one of the worst in our state. Not to mention that he cheated on his wife with three different women. By the way, one of them is your wife. Yes, I know him.
The lawyer is neither alive nor dead. The judge asked the prosecutor and the lawyer to approach him and said in a very low voice:
"If any of you idiots ask her if she knows me, I'll send you both to the electric chair."
