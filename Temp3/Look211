Vovochkin's teacher came to his house to talk to his parents and complains to his father:
- Your son, in response to a remark addressed to him, replied that he hates me.
The father answers the teacher:
- I'll deal with him now.
He goes to the window and shouts into the yard:
- Vodka, did you swear with the teacher?
Vovka:
- Well, you swore. And what?
Father: - Did you promise to fuck her?
Vovka:
- Well, there was a case.
Father:
- So why the fuck did you go for a walk then? Run home, she's already here!
