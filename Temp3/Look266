An agitated woman comes to the neurologist's office complaining of constant headaches. The doctor, after reviewing all the tests, carefully examining and probing the appetizing forms of the patient, asks:
- Honey, are you actually married?
Woman:
- I'm not married yet!
Doctor:
- Then I don't understand anything at all.
