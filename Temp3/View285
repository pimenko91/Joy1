The husband comes home from work and tells his wife:
- Come on, quickly undress and quickly, quickly, and go to bed. I'm barely holding on anymore.
The wife was very surprised:
- How do you undress? How's bed? For what? You've forgotten about it for three years now. Has it really struck?
The husband insists:
- Yes, I'm telling you to undress. Now you'll see what real sex is.
The wife begins to frantically undress, jumps into bed and calls her husband. The husband asks again:
- Undressed? All? Are you ready? I did it! Since April 1st, you, dear!
