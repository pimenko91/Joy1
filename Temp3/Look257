In a crowded bus, a girl got tired of a young man pressed against her from behind. She:
- Listen to you, how much can you push me with this thing!
The young man:
- I'm sorry, but this is not the thing that you think, but a wallet with my salary.
Girl:
- You must be a great employee if your salary has been raised four times in the past half hour.
