After a long sermon, the priest asked the parishioners if they were ready to forgive their enemies. Half of them raised their hands. Dissatisfied with the result, the priest continued to speak for another 30 minutes, and then repeated his question. This time, about 85% of the parishioners raised their hands. The priest preached for another 25 minutes and asked again if they were ready to forgive their enemies. The tired parishioners responded unanimously, and only one elderly lady abstained. The priest asks her:
- Mrs. Jones, are you not ready to forgive your enemies?
The old lady answers:
- And I have no enemies.
Priest:
- This is quite strange! How old are you?
The old lady:
- Ninety-three.
Priest:
- Mrs. Johnson, I ask you to come forward and tell us how a person can live to the age of 93 without having a single enemy.
A sweet little old lady slowly walked out into the center of the temple, turned to the parishioners and said:
- It's simple. I've just been through all these bitches.
