The genicologist was left without a job. I came to get a job at a car service. The director tells him:
- If you pass the test, then we'll take it. The maximum score is 100 points. The engine needs to be disassembled and assembled.
The gynecologist disassembles and assembles the engine. The director looks dumbfounded at the work done and says:
- 150 points and the deputy's degree. The director of the service!
Gynecologist:
- How so? The maximum score is 100 points.
Director:
- I've seen a lot of craftsmen, but not like that... 50 points for disassembly, 50 points for assembly and another 50 for doing everything through the exhaust pipe.
