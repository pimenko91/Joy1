The wife comes home and sees that her husband is sitting with his stomach pressed against a hot radiator and his head is wrapped in a towel. Wife:
- What's the matter with you? Are you sick?
Husband:
- no. This is a new way of experiencing how to get drunk without drinking. I ate 200 grams of yeast, a glass of sugar and washed it down with a liter of water. Alcohol should ferment and separate now.
Wife:
- And why is the head wrapped up?
Husband:
- So that the lid does not tear off.
My wife went into the kitchen to cook and suddenly hears a loud bang in the room. The wife screams at her husband:
- What, did the lid come off?
Husband:
- No, this bottom is knocked out!
