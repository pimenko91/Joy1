The guy says to the girl:
- Come on, let's go to my place. Let's drink tea, listen to music, have a good morning.
Girl:
- Well, no thanks!
The girl leaves with an offended look. The guy's thoughts:
- I should have suggested it more delicately. I'm a fool! I blurted it out without thinking.
The girl's thoughts:
- Well, that's an idiot... How many times have I told him that I don't drink tea, only coffee!
