Wedding night, newlyweds lying in bed, wine, candles, romance, beauty. Suddenly the wife:
- Honey, you know, I'm still a virgin and I don't know anything about this, well, about sex. Tell me, how does this happen?
The husband who unexpected such a turn:
- Of course, my dear! For example, between your legs, it's like a prison, and what's between my legs, it's like a prisoner. Now we take the prisoner and put him in jail. That's it...
we did it for the first time, the husband fell on the pillow, happy, resting, the wife is all excited:
- Darling, it seems to me that a prisoner has escaped from prison.
Husband:
- Yeah? Uh. Then we need to put him back in jail.
A few more times in different poses. After the next time, the husband, exhausted and short of breath, falls on the pillow, reaches for a cigarette with a shaking hand and hears:
- Darling, darling, it may seem to me, but the prisoner has escaped again!
The husband nervously:
- Yes, your mother, he was not given a life sentence!
