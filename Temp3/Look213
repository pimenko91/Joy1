Vovochka comes to dad and says:
- Dad, you are being called to school.
The father is interested in:
- What happened again?
Vovochka tells:
- In math class, they asked me how much is 7x9? I answered 63. And 9x7? I replied, what's the x% difference?
Dad:
- Okay, I'll be at school tomorrow.
The next day, Vovochka comes to Dad again:
- Dad, didn't you go to school today?
Father:
- No, I didn't have time. There's a lot to do, I didn't have time.
Vovochka:
- Well, you go to school, go to the physical education teacher, he wants to see you too.
Father with interest:
- And in physical education, what happened?
Vovochka:
- The teacher tells me, Vovochka, raise your right hand. I picked it up. Now raise your left hand. I picked it up. Now lift your right leg. I picked it up. Now lift your left leg. I tell me what to stand on x%?
Father:
- Okay, Vovochka, tomorrow I'll go to both of them.
A day later, Vovochka returned to Dad:
- Dad, have you ever been to school?
Father:
- No, I'm busy at work, but I'll definitely come back tomorrow.
Vovochka:
- Dad, you don't have to go anymore, I was kicked out of school.
Father:
- How did you get kicked out? For what?
Vovochka:
- The headmaster called me. I go into the office, and there's a math teacher, a physical education teacher, and an art teacher sitting there.
Father:
- Am I a x% art teacher there?
Vovochka:
- So I also asked...
