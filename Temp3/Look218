A visitor comes to the doctor:
- Doctor, I swallowed a fly.
The Doctor:
- It's okay, now I'll give you a shot and everything will pass. Get undressed.
The visitor undressed. The doctor gives him an injection, suddenly a visitor:
- Ay, ay, Doctor, why does it hurt so much?
DOCTOR:
- What did you think, is dichlofos painless?
