Three men die and go to heaven. The Apostle Peter meets them.
- Well, guys, it's a big paradise, you can't get around, you have to drive. Here you are Andrey, you cheated on your wife twenty times. Here's a penny for you, go ahead. You're Igor, you cheated on your wife five times, well done, here's a Ford for you. Mikhail, you haven't cheated on your wife once! You've lived your life like a saint, here's a new Ferrari for you.
Some time passes and the two see Mikhail crying on the hood of his Ferrari. They ask him:
- What happened?
He answers:
- Yes, I met my wife, on roller skates.
