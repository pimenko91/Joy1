Two friends are talking. The first one:
- Don't you go fishing?
Second:
- Think about it, my wife won't let me in.
The first one:
- And you do as I do. I'll cook everything from Friday, on Saturday morning I throw back the blanket, look at my wife's ass and say:
"You've got an ass." My wife is offended, we quarrel. I'm fishing and fishing. I come in the evening and we make up.
The friend did so. I've been preparing gear since the evening. In the morning I threw back the blanket:
- That's an ass! Fuck this fishing trip!
