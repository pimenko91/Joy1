Judge:
- Defendant, you stole 300 million euros and hid them. You are sentenced to 15 years in prison. Your last word.
The defendant:
- I'm just a legend lover. When the wolf stole 300 million sheep and the hunters caught him and said we will kill you. The wolf said that the hunters should not kill him and for this he would give them 150 million sheep. The hunters agreed. Everyone was happy and lived happily ever after.
Judge:
- The court has reviewed the verdict and is touched by your love of legends. You are released right in the courtroom. You are a holy man.
