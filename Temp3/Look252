A miner comes home from work. The wife asks:
- Why is he so tortured. Tell me, what are you doing there?
The husband pours two buckets of coal under the bed, gives his wife a shovel in her hands and says:
- Take it out.
The wife climbs under the bed and begins to rake. The husband poured a bucket of water on the bed. The wife asks:
- what is it?
Husband:
- Water is oozing from the strata.
The husband climbs onto the bed and starts jumping. Wife:
"What's that?"
Husband:
- The roof is going down.
The wife gets out from under the bed holding her lower back. Her husband punches her up to the most don't mess around. Wife:
- For what dear?
Husband:
- For the early departure!
