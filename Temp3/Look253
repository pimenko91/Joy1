Department of the Russian language. Two assistant professors, one smokes, the second solves a crossword puzzle and asks:
- Maria Petrovna, "The complete collapse of all hopes", six letters, the second "and".
The smoker thinks for a long time, then:
- It can't be! In the newspaper?
- N%zdets?
The second:
- It fits...
The head of the department, the professor, enters. The second one asks her a question:
- Sofya Markovna, here you are a doctor of sciences! "The complete collapse of all hopes," six letters, the second "and".
Sofya Markovna:
- N%well done! Definitely!
The second assistant professor:
- Well, it can't be in the central Russian newspaper - n%zdets!
Sofya Markovna:
- Now is the time, anything can happen!
The graduate student Masha enters, a young innocent creature. The second assistant professor:
- Our young people are advanced, they know everything! Masha, "The complete collapse of all hopes", six letters, the second "and". We all have only one option - N%zdets!
Masha, blushing, whispers:
- The fiasco.
All the others in chorus:
- Well, n%here!
