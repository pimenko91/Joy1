Two alcoholics are sitting, drinking. One asks the other:
- What is logic?
The second one responds:
- Well, how can I explain it to you?.. You see two men walking, one dirty, the other clean. Which one of them goes to the bathhouse?
The first one responds:
- Dirty of course.
Second:
- Absolutely right. He's dirty, so he's going to wash up. This is called logic.
The first one asks another question:
- And what is dialectics?
Second:
- You see, two men are coming. One is dirty and the other is clean. Which one of them goes to the bathhouse?
The first one repeats:
- Dirty.
The second corrects:
- That's wrong! Clean. He is dirty because he never goes to the bathhouse. This is the dialectic.
The first one again:
- And what about philosophy, then?
The second one is based on the same example:
- You see... Two men are walking, dirty and clean. Which one of them goes to the bathhouse?
The first one is not finding an answer:
- Who the fuck knows...
the second one:
- That's just philosophy!
