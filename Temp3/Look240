A man was swimming in the sea and swam behind a buoy and suddenly hears a voice from nowhere:
- Plus two or minus two?
The man was scared and after thinking answered:
- Plus two.
He went ashore looking, and now he has 4 eggs. He decided to fix this case. Thinks:
- I'll swim behind the buoy again, and I'll say minus two.
A voice floated out of nowhere again:
- Plus four or minus four?
