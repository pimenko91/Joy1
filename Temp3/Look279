A man is riding on the top shelf of a compartment car. At the next station, a collective farmer sits in a compartment. He takes out lard, onions, pickles, vodka and eats with gusto. The man, watching all this, thinks that it would not be bad to join:
- Dear madam, what is your name at least?
She poured another glass of vodka:
- Don't call me. I'll have a drink, I'll have a snack and I'll climb up to you myself!
