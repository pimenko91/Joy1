Two friends meet. One of them came to the meeting on a brand new bike. The second one asks:
- Great bike! How much did you give?
The first one:
- I got it for free!
The second one:
- Well, how is it? Tell me!
The first one:
- I was walking late in the park yesterday. A young girl rides up to me on this bike, takes off her skirt and panties and says that I can get whatever I want. So I chose a bike!
Second:
- Wise! Your skirt didn't fall off a fig, and you probably wouldn't have fit in your underpants...
