A young guy at the pharmacy:
- I need one condom.
The pharmacist:
- Alone?
Guy:
- Yes, I'm going to a girl's for dinner today.
After a little thought:
- Although she has a sister, too, nothing, let's have two.
After thinking more:
- Actually, her mother is not bad-looking either, let's have three.
In the evening I went to my friend's, sat red as a tomato all through dinner, didn't say a single word. After dinner, they go to a friend's room. Girlfriend:
- What's the matter with you today, have you been silent all evening? Did something happen?
Boy:
- You didn't tell me that your dad works as a pharmacist.
