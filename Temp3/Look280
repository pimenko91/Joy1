The secretary comes to be hired in the office. All of myself, super sexy. They look at her with disbelief and ask:
- What about computers? We have needs here.
She:
- Wordmile, Microsoft Word, Windows. No problem...
they continue:
- And foreign languages? We need a polyglot here.
She lists:
- English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese and a little Sanskrit.
Final question:
- Well, what salary would you like?
- $ 5,000
Those:
- That's a lot. Only the chief engineer gets a drain from us!
She:
- Well, then it's the fucking ones!
