Friday evening. Two friends have rested in a bar after a week of work and are going home. Winter, frost. One:
- Listen, my friend, I want to piss, I don't have the strength.
The second godfather:
- So get up to the fence and get out. It's dark outside, no one will see!
The first:
- That's not the task. I forgot my gloves at work. I unbuttoned it, but I can't get it out, my fingers are frozen.! You're my friend. Please take it out.
The godfather tries to get horseradish out of the fly of the godfather, misses in the dark and gets his hand in his pocket, gropes there for a pickle from a snack, takes it out and tries to see and says:
- Godfather, I'm sorry, of course, but it looks like I tore your dick off!
That:
- Then I feel the blood gushing down my legs!
