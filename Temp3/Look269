Dad and son went to the mountains and the son, hitting a stone, shouted:
- Ahhh!
And he is surprised to hear:
- A-A-A.
The boy asked:
- Who are you?
And in response, he hears:
- Who are you?
The boy, angry, screams:
- You're a fool!
And in response to him:
- You're a fool!
The boy asks his father:
- What's going on?
The father smiled and said:
- Listen to me carefully.
The father screams woe:
- I respect you!
In response to him:
- I respect you!
Father:
- You are the best.
They answer him:
- You're the best.
Turning to his son, he says:
- You see, son, I am the best and I am respected. And you're a fool.
