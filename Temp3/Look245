A biker drove into the 600th mers. Well, he thinks everything is over for sure now, there's nothing to lose, at least I'll take a break before I die. He takes out a bat and starts hitting the merc, whipped it all up. No one came out. The biker got on his bike and drove away. There are brothers sitting in the merce, one says to the other:
- And you think if we drove into it!
