St. Peter at the threshold of paradise:
- Who were you on earth?
The dead man:
- A football referee!
Saint Peter:
- I know you, everyone is paid there!
The dead man:
- I was honest! In the final match between Russia and France, a minute before the whistle, with the score tied 2-2, I awarded a penalty to Russia!
Saint Peter:
- I don't remember that. When was that again?
The dead man:
- Ten minutes ago.
