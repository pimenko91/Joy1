Two men are sitting at home, talking for life. The wife of one of them is busy in the kitchen. The conversation turned to women, one of them asks in a half-whisper:
- Sanya, how many women have you had in total?
Sanya calculated in his mind and proudly replied in the same half-whisper:
- 25!
His wife's ironic voice comes from the kitchen:
- Sasha, they don't ask you how many times you've had, but how many women!
