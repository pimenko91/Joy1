A Chief is riding across the prairie. Suddenly, the Indian sees the Red Sun lying with his ear pressed to the road. The chief asks him:
- What do you hear, Red Sun?
He answers:
"There's a big wagon coming with pale-faces, about thirty of them, all with guns. One of them is bald. The cart's right rear wheel creaks. Two horses. One is piebald, the other is black.
The chief is surprised:
- Red Sun, how did you find out all this? Did the trembling of the earth tell you?
The Red Sun says:
- No, Chief! It's just that these freaks just ran over me!
