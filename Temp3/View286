The graduate is going to the ball. He goes up to his mother and asks:
- Mom, and if I kiss a boy on the lips, can I get pregnant?
The mother smiled:
- No, of course not.
She continues:
- And if you kiss with your tongue in a hickey?
Mother:
- You can't get pregnant either.
That one again:
- And if the boy doesn't have m% to do?
Mother:
- No, you won't get pregnant.
The daughter does not lag behind:
- Well, what if through anal sex?
The mother changed her face and said:
- Daughter, what are you saying? Are you going to do all this at graduation?
Daughter:
- No, Mom, don't worry. I'm just trying to figure out who the father is.
