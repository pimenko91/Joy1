Husband and wife are talking:
- Darling, I have to tell you a secret, I can't hide it anymore.
His wife tensed slightly:
- Come on, tell me.
Husband:
- I want you to forgive me, I can't lie anymore.
Wife:
- Well, don't delay, tell me!
Husband:
- Our daughter, not from you!
Wife in tears:
- How so? And you've been silent all these years!
After a minute, the wife came to her senses:
- You idiot!
