Daughter calls mom:
- Mom, I had such a big fight with my husband, it's just like a kick-ass!
Mother:
- Well, never mind, daughter, there are quarrels and disagreements in every familyâ€¦
The daughter interrupts:
- Mom, thanks for the advice and support, of course. What should I do with the corpse?
