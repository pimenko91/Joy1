A woman and her lover had sex while her husband was at work. Her nine-year-old son was peeping out of the closet. Suddenly the husband came and the wife hid her lover in the closet, not knowing that her son was there.
Boy:
- It's dark in here.
Lover:
- Yeah.
Boy:
- And I have a soccer ball. You probably want to buy it?
Lover:
- No, thanks.
Boy:
- And my father is outside in the room.
Lover:
- Okay, okay. How much do you want, little blackmailer?
Boy:
- 250 dollars.
After a while, the boy came back:
- It's dark in here.
Lover:
- Yeah.
Boy:
- I have sneakers and they are also for sale!
Lover:
- I understand you. How much?
Boy:
- $750.
Lover:
- Okay, here you go, just keep quiet.
A week after that, the father tells his son:
- Let's go play football.
Boy:
- I'm not going, I don't have a ball or a crass. I sold everything.
Father:
- Well, how much did you get for them?
Boy:
- 1000 dollars.
Father:
- It's defiant. A ball and sneakers don't cost that much money! You need to go to church and repent.
The boy came to the church, looked around and said:
- It's dark in here.
Priest:
- Bl@ just don't start with that x%yni again!
