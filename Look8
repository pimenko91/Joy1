Urka served another period of time in the zone, went out, did not recognize Moscow, everything is so diamond. He goes into the Chocolate Shop, sits down at a table, everything is clean, level. A waitress girl runs up to him and asks:
- What will you order?
Urka:
- Yes, my daughter, I'm not rich today, bring me a hot cup of tea, that's all.
Girl:
- We have such a rich assortment! Black, green, fruity... Which one do you like?
Urka:
- Well, I've been in Moscow recently, I don't even know, bring it to your taste.
The girl runs into the kitchen and nervously tells:
We have such a visitor sitting here. His teeth are all gold, he's full of thug tattoos, probably just got free. He asked for tea to suit my taste. And if he doesn't like it, he'll stab me with a knife and not blink an eye!
The cook says:
- Yes, I know what kind of seagulls they drink there!
The cook takes half a kilo of tea and a liter of boiling water, brews and the girl brings this teapot to the visitor. Urka pours a cup, drinks with a grunt, looks at the girl and says:
- Yes, daughter, already in the course of life, she shook you out of your mind...
