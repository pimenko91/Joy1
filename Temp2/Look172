The traffic cop stops the car:
- You ran a red light. Your documents.
Driver:
- I don't have a license. And there was no time!
The driver's wife:
- Oh, don't listen to him, he's drunk and he's making up something else!
The driver's mother-in-law from the back seat:
- Well, have you arrived? I told you we wouldn't get far in a stolen car!
Father-in-law's voice from the trunk:
- What is the border already?
