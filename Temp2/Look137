Ivan the fool is going on a long journey. On the way we come across a hut with a baba Yaga. Ivan the fool decided to take a break. He went into the hut, Baba Yaga fed him, watered him, made his bed and asked:
- Ivanushka, are you going to sleep alone or with my daughter?
Ivanushka thinks that Yaga is a thousand years old at lunch and her daughter is probably three hundred years old, at least. Says Yage:
- I'll lie down alone, what's there...
he wakes up in the morning, and a long-legged beauty brings him breakfast in bed. Ivanushka asks:
- Who the hell are you?
The beauty responds:
- Baba Yaga's daughter, Vasilisa. What's your name?
He answers:
- Ivan is a FOOL, that's my name!
