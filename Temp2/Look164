The precinct will conduct a conversation with the grandfather moonshiner.
- Avdeich, stop driving!
- I drove, I drive and I will drive.
- After all, we'll plant it!
- The son will drive.
- And we'll put our son in jail!
- The grandson will drive.
- And we'll put the grandson away!
- Well, by that time, I'll be out!
