Vovochka was late for class once again and the teacher shouted loudly at him:
- What's your reason today?
Vovochka was confused and did not find anything better than to answer:
- I'm just saying %y
The teacher slowed down:
- Even though you were rude, you told the truth, so I will not punish you and this will be an example to everyone else. Children, do you understand everything?
And the whole class, together in chorus:
- Clear x%y!
