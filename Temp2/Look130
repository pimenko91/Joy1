A local walks along the shore of the lake and sees some guy scooping water from the lake with his hand and drinking. The local screams:
- What are you doing? Why are you drinking this dirty water, the plant drains waste here, the drain from the whole village comes out here!
Guy:
- Not to hear. What did you say?
Local:
- Yes, I say, scoop it up with two hands!
