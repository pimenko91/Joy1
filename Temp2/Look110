There is a traffic cop under the sign 40. A Zaporozhets is driving, he exceeded the speed by 2 km. The traffic cop stopped the Zaporozhets, the grandfather gets out of it. The traffic cop told him:
- You exceeded the speed limit. Pay the fine or I'll take your license.
The grandfather begged:
- I don't have any money, son.
Traffic cop:
- Well, then I'm taking my license!
At this moment, a foreign car is rushing at breakneck speed. The traffic cop whistles, the car stops. A two-meter tall bully climbs out of a foreign car:
- I don't understand... Who was whistling at me?
The traffic cop fucked up, and the grandfather tells him:
- Give me back my license, or I'll tell you who whistled!
