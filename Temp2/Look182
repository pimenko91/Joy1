An intern from the FSB school asks the head to load him with work. As always, there is no one who disavows, dismissing the boring student, entrusts him with a deliberately impossible task. We need to uncover the network of agents of all foreign intelligence agencies around the world. A couple of hours later, the student comes in and reports, putting full information about foreign intelligence services, including ours, on the chief's table. The boss is at a loss:
- But how? How did you manage that?
Student:
- Well, there is the Internet!
