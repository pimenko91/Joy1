A merchant on his Mercedes, got into an accident. Got out of the car and wails:
- What kind of car did you smash, what kind of car! And the clothes... Versace, Makvin, now it's all in the trash! I've been working like a damn for so many years!
An ambulance arrives at the accident. The doctor runs up to the merchant:
- Man, your arm has been torn off!
Merchant:
- Well, damn it, even before the pile and the Rolex...
