At the intersection, waiting for the arrow to light up, an old Zaporozhets. The arrow lit up, "Zaporozhets" carefully begins to turn in the specified direction. And a Kruzak sticks into his side. He climbs out of the jeep and begins to press a profitable man, the owner of the Zaporozhets, Who tries to explain everything to them:
- Guys, I was just going to the arrow!
Friends:
- Fuck, do you think we're just riding?
