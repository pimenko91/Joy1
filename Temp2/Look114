A man came up to a neighbor's house and knocks on the fence. No one. Knocking again. Again, no one. Suddenly he sees a dog coming up from the other side of the fence and says in a human voice:
- Well, what are you knocking? Don't you see, if they don't open, then no one is at home?
The man fainted. He opens his eyes. The same dog is standing over him. Man to her:
- Dog, can't you bark?
Dog:
- Why can't I do it? I can. I just didn't want to scare you.
