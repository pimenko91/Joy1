There is a call to the duty station at night. A hysterical voice screams:
- Hello, the Police! Bandits are breaking in on us!
The attendant in a sleepy voice lazily:
- Well?
- Oh, they've already broken the door!
- Well?
- God, they're coming here!
- Well?
- We told them that we were calling the police!
- Well?
- And they sent you to x%!
The attendant briskly:
- Opp-a!
