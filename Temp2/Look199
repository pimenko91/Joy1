The count wakes up in the morning at his estate. He gets out of bed and sees the maid cleaning up. He asks her,
"Where is the Countess?"
Maid:
- Countess, she called to come down.
Word for word, in the end, the count fucked the maid. He went downstairs to the kitchen and asked the cook:
- And where is the Countess?
The cook:
- Countess, I went to the garden
With the cook, word for word, and her fuck. He goes into the garden and asks the gardener:
- Tell me, charm, where is the Countess?
Gardener:
- Countess, I was pleased to swim in the pool.
The count and the gardener were fucked. He goes to the pool, looks, the Countess is swimming. He told her:
"Countess, Mother, there you are! I'm fucking looking for you!
