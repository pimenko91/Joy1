The executioner spent the whole night carefully preparing for the 1000th anniversary execution, sharpened the axe to the state of a razor. In the morning, the condemned man puts his head on the block, an axe swing, a blow...
the condemned man:
- Is that all?
The executioner:
- Yes.
The condemned man:
- And why don't I feel anything?
The executioner:
- And you nod!
