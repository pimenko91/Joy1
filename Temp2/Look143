A middle-aged woman had a heart attack. While the doctors were fighting for her life in the operating room, she saw the Almighty in front of her and asked him:
Is this the end? Am I going to die now?
The Almighty flipped through his notes and replied:
- Your time will come in 40 years, 7 weeks, 3 days and 6 hours.
Recovering from anesthesia after surgery, the woman, since she was born for the second time, asked the doctor to make all possible plastic changes to her. Tighten your face, remove all fat, enlarge your breasts, adjust your nose, lips, eyes, generally make a completely different person out of her. Then she invited a cosmetologist. I dyed my hair blonde, got a manicure. She was discharged from the hospital, the happiest one is walking, before she could leave the territory, she was knocked down to death by an ambulance. She saw the Almighty again, turns to him again:
- My God, you said that I would live for more than 40 years!
To which the Almighty replied:
- Well, I'm sorry, I didn't find out...
