The wedding night. The man and his wife are completely inexperienced and know nothing about sex. A man calls a friend:
- Kolyan, what should I do?
Kolyan:
- Did you undress your wife?
Guy:
- No!
Kolyan:
Well, undress her and undress yourself. Is the pine tree standing?
The man does not understand the meaning, looks out the window and sees a pine tree standing next to it:
- It's worth it!
Kolyan:
- Get on it!
A naked man goes outside and climbs a pine tree. Then he asks:
- What's next?
Kolyan:
- Now swing...
the man is sitting on a branch, swinging. Kolyan after a couple of minutes:
- Well, did you break it?
Guy:
- Not yet.
Kolyan:
- Keep rocking!
The man swings on a branch and then the branch breaks with a crunch and falls down with the man.
Kolyan:
- Well, did you break it?
The man is pleased:
- Yes, I broke it!
Kolyan:
Is there any blood?
Guy:
- yes. Out of the ear!
Kolyan:
- Well, you're a pervert!
