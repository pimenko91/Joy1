The bear sowed cannabis in the clearing, the cannabis rose and the bear climbed a tall birch tree and is on guard. A hedgehog is walking by:
- Oops! Konopelechka... I'm going to kill myself!
He scored a joint and starts smoking. The bear admires the whole thing and thinks:
- Well, fuck it... Well, hold on, the ball is prickly...
He gets down from the birch tree, takes a shovel and crept up behind him. The hedgehog bit a couple of times, closed his eyes from coming, and at that moment the bear hit him on the head with a shovel. The hedgehog passed out, fell down, and the bear climbed back onto the birch tree.
An hour later, the hedgehog recovered a little and thought to himself:
- Aw, the hemp is good... I still haven't completely let go, my head is buzzing. I need to take it with me.
I took a scythe and let's mow. The bear almost fell off the birch tree from what he saw. Looking at this, he thinks:
- The hedgehog has completely lost his fear... It's like in your garden...
He climbed down from the birch tree again and again with a shovel approaches the hedgehog from behind. And he's still mowing in a semi-fainting state. The bear hit him on the head with a shovel again with all the dope. The hedgehog kicks to the ground, immediately jumps up and raves:
- Don't sleep, I said mow, don't sleep, don't sleep, mow...
