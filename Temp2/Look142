The hostess approaches the house, and a cat lies in the middle of the yard. The hostess is talking about the cat out loud:
- It fell apart... He has food and water, he doesn't need to do anything, he lies in the sun all day long. I wish I had such a life!
The cat lies and thinks:
- She drowned my children, sterilized my wife, castrated me.
- You should have such a life! I don't mind...
