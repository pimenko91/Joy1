A journalist writes a note about interesting people and interviews a blind pilot:
- Tell me, how do you fly blind?
The pilot says,
"It's just that. Takeoff without problems, the speed dictates how you accelerate the handle on yourself and gain altitude, and there is an autopilot.
Journalist:
- Well, what about the landing?
Pilot:
- The handle from myself, I'm falling into a steep dive, and as I hear the voice of the flight engineer in my headphones, they say this blind bitch is going to ruin us now, the handle smoothly on itself and that's it, we sit down!
