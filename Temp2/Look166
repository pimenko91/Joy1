Representatives of the sect:
- How do you feel about the predictions of the coming apocalypse?
- Nothing.
- Excuse me? Well, the world flood, for example…
- That's okay. I have fishing boots and a raincoat tent, a rubber boat.
- And if a meteorite falls on the planet?
- Yes, we know, we've already fallen. A helicopter crashed into a neighbor's temporary shelter.
- My God! Did everyone die?
- Everything is in the helicopter. The neighbor opened his eyes the next morning, came out of the temporary shelter, looked at the Japanese helicopter.
- Well, what if there are fires?
- We live near the water, nothing will light up. And the smoke... so I also brought a gas mask from the army…
- If giant tsunamis rise! The impact of such a wave...
- My watch is shockproof. And I have boots and a boat, as I said before…
- Well, what if there is a pandemic?
- Pandas, of course, are rare animals, but if they fall down, there is a machine gun that I brought from the army…
- No, a pandemic is an epidemic, the spontaneous spread of an incurable, deadly disease!
- There are no such diseases. I drank 300 grams of alcohol, had a bite of garlic and steamed in the bath…
- Everything is clear with you. You are Russian! John, let's get out of here.
