They are traveling in a car to Moscow with people of Caucasian nationality. At the checkpoint, they are stopped by a traffic police officer:
- Hello. Lieutenant Grigoriev. In light of the latest law, persons of Caucasian nationality entering the city are required to hand over a bucket of sperm! Here's a bucket for you, a little forest behind the post, go and drink...
They took the bucket and left. After 20 minutes, they bring a bucket, and there's just a little bit at the bottom.
GBDD employee:
- Citizens, it's not my whim, look here is a paper with a seal. This is the law. Do you understand? The law! Keep going!
Gone again. Two hours later, they bring half a bucket, they are already on their knees, they ask to let go. But the employee is unwavering, requires a whole bucket. Already after midnight, barely alive Caucasians arrive with a bucket full.
Employee:
- Well, that's another matter. Here are your documents, have a nice trip!
They left. Employee Grigoriev takes a bucket, goes to the ditch, which is already full of sperm, pours it there and sings:
- An unforgettable city, but it can sleep peacefully...
