In the store, a man approaches the seller, pointing to the counter and says:
- Sell me this one, but don't tell me the name.
The seller:
- What is it?
Guy:
- Well, that one, just don't tell me what.
The seller:
- But what do you want to sell?
Guy:
- Well, there it is, it's on your shelf, just don't tell me.
The seller:
- Do you want vodka or something?
Guy:
- Yeah!
and he starts to vomit.
