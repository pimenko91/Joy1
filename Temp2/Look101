Two friends liked to drink. And, so that their wives would not prematurely fire before drinking, they agreed to communicate in terms of periodicals. Something like this:
- I bought a book at lunch, come and read it in the evening.
- I bought a fresh magazine, I'll bring it, let's look through it.
One day, one calls the other and says:
- Come soon, my father-in-law has arrived from the village, he has brought a high-quality manuscript!
