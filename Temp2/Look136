A man is walking along the road, seeing a well, he wanted to drink. I decided to check if there was water there. I threw a stone, silence. I threw a bigger stone, silence again. I threw a bully, not a fig. He takes a piece of rail lying next to it and puts it in the well... Suddenly a kid runs up and jumps into the well. The man thinks:
- Even some kind of bullshit...
a local guy comes up to the guy and asks:
- Listen, have you seen the kid?
The man answers:
- I literally just jumped into the well!
Local:
- It's strange. He seems to have tied him tightly to the rail...
