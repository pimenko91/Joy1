The Hussar, a friend of Lieutenant Rzhevsky, addresses a secular lady:
- Madam, when Lieutenant Rzhevsky comes to the ball today, immediately take your daughter to her room and do not leave her side.
Madame is interested:
- Do you really suppose that the lieutenant will decide to dishonor her right at the ball of the noble assembly?
Hussar:
- Come on, the rumors about Rzhevsky's sexual aggressiveness are too exaggerated.
Madam:
- Then I don't understand, you know that the rumors are exaggerated and yet you advise me to take my daughter awayâ€¦
The Hussar:
- I know, but your daughter doesn't know!
