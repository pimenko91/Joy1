A guy and a girl break up a relationship:
- Masha, well, if I don't find anyone for myself in a week, can I at least come and eat borscht?
- What kind of borscht? Get out of here so my eyes don't see you!
- Masha, well, if I don't find anyone for myself in two weeks, can I come and wash my clothes?
- What the fuck kind of clothes, get out of here, so that my eyes don't see you!
- Masha, well, if I don't find anyone for myself in a month, can I come, well, what's his name? Well, once?
- Well, if in a month, and no one, well, then come. But from behind, but only from behind, so that my eyes don't see you!
