Soviet times. Draft beer, sold in kvass barrels. An intelligent-looking, pre-retirement-age man approaches the beer seller and asks:
- Dear, how much does a barrel of beer cost?
The seller tells him the cost, the man takes out the money, pays off, the seller leaves the point and the man begins to pour beer for free to everyone. After half an hour, he created such a stir that eventually a beating began. The police squad that arrived, after calming the crowd, asked the man:
- What the hell are you doing here? Still an intellectual at first glance ...
the man answers:
- You see, I'm already old and I probably won't live to see our Bright Future!
- And I really want to see how it will be under Communism!
