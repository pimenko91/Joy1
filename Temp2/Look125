At the trial, the judge addresses the accused:
- The defendant explain why you, like an adequate person, graduated from a prestigious university... Why was the postman brutally beaten?
The defendant:
- And what would you do in my place? This postman came to me, showed me a registered letter, with the condition that he would give it to me if I danced.
Judge:
- So what are you?
The defendant:
- I danced like a madman for ten minutes, but it turned out to be a summons to the military enlistment office!
