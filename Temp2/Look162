Vasily Ivanovich comes to Petka and complains, his ass hurts. Petka advises:
- Vasil Ivanovich, there is a reliable folk remedy, you pour sour cream into a basin and sit there backwards.
Vasily Ivanovich:
- Yes, what are you, Petka, so that I am Commander Chapaev...
Petka to him:
- Come on, what's the big deal, I'll be on the lookout.
Chapaev pours sour cream into a basin, there is nothing to do, sits in it. Here Anka comes running to the headquarters with an urgent report. Petka won't let her see Chapaev. Anka broke through and seeing such a picture says:
- Well, Vasily Ivanovich, of course I saw how you cum, but how you refuel...
