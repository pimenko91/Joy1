The school celebrates Lenin's birthday. Pioneers in white shirts, a banner, drummers, that's it. The teacher invited grandfather Avdeich, who communicated with Lenin during the clean-up day, to tell him how it was at that difficult time. A stuck-up Avdeich comes and tells:
- It was like this. We are sitting on a clean-up day, smoking with the crew of sailors, suddenly some small, profitable peasant in a cap runs up and lets shout in a burr voice that they say we are sitting here doing nothing, we had to drag the log alone... I listened to him, listened and said - Fuck you, sweet man!
The teacher:
- Avdeich, what are you doing? Don't express yourself!
Avdeich to the teacher:
- And you go to x%y too!
The teacher:
- Avdeich, stop it, there are children here!
Avdeich:
- And the children too, let them go to x%y!
