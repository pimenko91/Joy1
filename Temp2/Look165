From the window of a skyscraper in New York, a man falls and breaks. The police arrived. They calculated the window and the apartment. They take the elevator up and ring the bell. A gorgeous blonde opens the door.
"Excuse me, miss, didn't a man fall out of your window?"
Blonde:
- Yes, from mine.
Policeman:
- Could you clarify under what circumstances?
Blonde:
- Yes, of course. We met on the plane. As is our custom, I invited him to my house. He, as is their custom, offered to go to the store on the way. I bought a bottle of whiskey, as is customary with us. As is their custom, he bought a bottle of vodka and two bottles of port. I poured myself half a glass and sipped, as is our custom, and, as is their custom, he drank all three bottles. I, as is customary with us, offered to go to bed. Then, as is customary with them, he offered to run for another one. Then we heard my husband opening the door with a key. I, as is customary with us, wanted to introduce them, he, as is customary with them, decided to leave through the window.
