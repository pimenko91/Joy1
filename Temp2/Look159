A bar for vampires. The end of a hot day. A cool vampire walks in and orders 300 grams of fresh arterial blood to the bartender. A homeless vampire approaches the bartender and asks the bartender for a glass of boiling water. The bartender clarifies:
- Only boiling water? Maybe something else?
The homeless vampire takes out a tampax and says:
- You don't need to. I have the tea leaves with me.
