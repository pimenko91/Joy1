In the store, a man asks the seller:
- Do you have a swimming cap?
The seller:
- No. From where?
The man:
- And the stick, do you want to play hockey?
- No way! From where?
The man:
- But at least there are skis?
The seller:
- Man, this is a wine and vodka store!
Guy:
- Well, God knows, I wanted to do sports.
- A bottle of vodka, please!
