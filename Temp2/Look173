Vasily Ivanovich returned from the Wild West.
Petka to him:
- Well, how is Vasily Ivanovich, there, in the West?
Vasily Ivanovich says:
- Order! Take Furmanov, vodka and both run to the headquarters.
They gathered at the headquarters, sat down at the table and Vasily Ivanovich begins:
- Well, guys, I'll show you what they taught me there.
He takes a bottle of vodka, throws it up, shoots. The bottle is shattered, and everyone's glasses are filled equally.
Petka:
- Oh, big deal. And I can do that.
He takes the next bottle, throws it up, shoots. The bottle is shattered. In Petka's glass, vodka almost spills over the edges, Vasili Ivanovich has less, and Furmanov has a couple of splashes on the bottom. Vasily Ivanovich:
- Petka, you still need to fill your hand!
Furmanov:
- And the muzzle too!
