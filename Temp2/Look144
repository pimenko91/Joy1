A man in a restaurant makes a claim:
- I'm sorry, what is it?
Waiter:
- This is fried chicken, as you ordered!
Man:
- Take it away and tell the cook that the chicken is undercooked!
Waiter:
- How undercooked is it?
Man:
- So much so that if I were a good veterinarian, I could save a chicken's life!
