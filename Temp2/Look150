The plane crashes. There was only one flight attendant left alive, having jumped with a parachute. Landed on a desert island. Having found no one, and from all that she had to go through in recent hours, she fell asleep. When she woke up, she saw a man who, as if in a normal household mode, was frying meat. She scratched her eyes and asked:
- Man. Who are you, where did you come from here?
The man answers:
- I'm a criminal. As a punishment, they left me alone on this island 10 years ago, they thought I would not survive. And as you can see, I don't live hard, I indulge in meat.
Stewardess:
- And I would eat. Will you buy me a drink?
Guy:
- And what will you offer in exchange for meat?
Stewardess:
- Well, unless you haven't tried it for 10 years!
The man jumps up, rushes to hug her:
- My dear, long-awaited one! Well, tell me you have vodka!
