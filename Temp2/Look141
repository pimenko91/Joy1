An inexperienced, novice hunter runs home from the first hunt and screams in panic from the doorstep:
- Galya, everything is gone, this is the end, trouble!
The wife asks:
- Well, what is it, what are you making a fuss about?
He:
- Where do we have the "Red Book"?
The wife brings it, he in a hurry, muttering something under his breath, flips through the pages. He scrolled to the end, relaxed back on the sofa and says:
- It seems to have passed... The men teased me... There is no huntsman in the "Red Book"!
