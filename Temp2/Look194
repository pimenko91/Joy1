Caught a fisherman by the fish supervision and says:
- You got a guy, on such a fine! You can't catch fish here!
Fisherman:
- Well, I'm not catching her!
Rybnadzor:
- Are you taking me for a fool? Is this in your bag, what?
Fisherman:
- This is my fish, I'm taking it for a walk. I let it out, then I whistle, she comes back and we go home.
Fishing control:
- Here you are a pussy @bol! Can you show me?
The fisherman released all the fish. They stand, look, the fish supervision says:
- Well, let's whistle.
Fisherman:
- What the fuck?
Fish supervision:
- To get the fish back.
Fisherman:
- What kind of x% fish is it?
