A phone call in a plumber's house:
- Hello, this is your doctor. My toilet is clogged. Could you come to me urgently?
Plumber:
- How are you not welcome. I'm just going out with a friend to a restaurant and I've already dressed up.
Doctor:
- But after all, if something starts to hurt you, then as a doctor, I always come to you on the first call. Could you do the same for me?
Twenty minutes later, a plumber at the doctor's house in a suit, in expensive shoes, examines a clogged toilet, throws a couple of pills into the toilet and says:
- Now watch this for a couple of days, and if it doesn't help, then call me again.
