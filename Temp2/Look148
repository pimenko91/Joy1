There is a Russian language lesson going on. The teacher gives the task to come up with words for the letter B. Vovochka sharply raises her hand, but the teacher, fearing vulgarity, does not pay attention to him. Kolya answers:
- Bolts.
The teacher gives him an A, gives him the task to come up with a word with the letter P, Vovochka pulls his hand again, but Masha answers:
- Dumplings.
The teacher gives Masha a five and the next word needs to be invented with the letter R. Vovochka pulls her hand with all her might. The teacher, having mentally sorted out the options and not finding the matyugs with the letter R, asks Vovochka. He gets up very slowly and says with displeasure:
- Bolts, dumplings... The man is shitting himself because of you!
- Fuck off!
