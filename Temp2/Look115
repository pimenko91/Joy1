W: Come on, come on, hold the end!
M: Where's the hole?
W: I don't see either
M: You're a woman, you should know! Ah, I found it! Hold the end!
F: Well, are you fussing, no?
M: Yes, ept, I can't get it, sun itself!
F: Here are the men, they can't do anything themselves!
M: Wait! You seem to have put it in the wrong place!
W: What do you mean, not there? There's nowhere else to go!
M: Yes, and even the wrong end ...
F: Calm down!
M: Bl@t, I don't like it at all!
F: So tuck the blanket into the duvet cover, no one likes it.
