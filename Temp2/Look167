Three sisters are getting married. Their mother tells them:
- Don't forget to write letters. But if you write about sex, write that you fried potatoes. Because Dad can read and think something is wrong.
After some time, the first daughter writes:
- Everything is fine, we have enough money, we live together with my husband, we don't need anything, we fry potatoes once a year.
The mother thinks:
- This is not an order.
Her second daughter writes to her:
- Everything is fine with us. We have enough money, we fry potatoes once a month.
The mother thinks:
- Not that, of course, but it's better.
Her third daughter writes to her:
- There is no money, there is nothing to eat, we fry potatoes three times a day, and when we don't fry potatoes, he licks the pan, and I suck the pen.
