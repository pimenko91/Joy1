An old friend came to visit the peasant. They are sitting at the table. A man periodically turns to his wife:
- Darling, please bring some more tea.
"Honey, would you be so kind as to give me the sugar?"
- Honey, your dessert is incomparable, can I have more?
While the wife goes to get dessert, the friend admires:
- I envy you! You've been married for so long, and you still call her with such affectionate words!
To which he responds:
- You're good! I just forgot her name!
