The daughter consults with the mother:
- Mom, I'm probably going to break up with my boyfriend.
Mother:
- Why is that?
Daughter:
- I think he's an alcoholic. Yesterday we were dancing, he snuggled up to me and I felt that he had a bottle in his pants.
Mother:
- And what is it about?
Daughter:
- 0.7 at least!
Mother:
- Daughter, don't leave him. You're lucky! I've been messing with a check all my life!
