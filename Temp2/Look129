A warden and a priest enter the death row cell. The warden addresses the prisoner:
- Your case has been reviewed, the death sentence has been overturned and you are free.
The prisoner starts yelling, jumping like he's not normal, almost fainting with joy, climbs up to hug the newcomers... Here the priest adds:
- Now smile. You are being filmed by a hidden camera!
