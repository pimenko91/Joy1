The husband asks his wife:
- Honey, what kind of coffee do you prefer?
The wife responds:
I prefer a strong, but soft, impetuous and gentle one that would open up a world of temptations and unrestrained sensuality for me, spin me around and give me new sensations...
Husband:
- And, like, just pour vodka for you?
