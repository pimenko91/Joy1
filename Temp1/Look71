The husband comes home and sees bare feet behind the curtain. He turns to his wife:
- What is this?
His wife:
- What do you think, all my jewelry, fur coats, it's all on your salary?
Husband again:
- I'm asking you again, what is this!
Wife waving her arms:
- The apartment, the car, your criminal position in the ministry... Where do you think this is all from?
Husband:
- I'm asking you for the last time! Why is the breadwinner barefoot?
