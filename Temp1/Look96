Three Frenchmen met. Wine, champagne, cognac. We had a drink, sat down and culturally dispersed.
Three Russians met. Vodka, moonshine, alcohol. They drank, made faces at each other, and broke up.
Three Arabs met. They fired on a bus, hijacked a plane and exploded. That's the kind of entertainment, under the dry law.
