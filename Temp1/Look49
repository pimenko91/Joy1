The policeman returned from duty in the morning, undressed to go to bed, and his wife screams from the bedroom:
- Go to the stall for a beer!
The policeman, gritting his teeth, puts back into his uniform and into the stall.
A familiar seller at the stall asks him:
- Quit the police?
The policeman answers:
- Well, why would I?
Seller:
- You're wearing a firefighter's uniform.
