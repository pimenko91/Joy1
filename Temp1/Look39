My wife came home with a new ring. Husband:
- Where did the ring come from?
Wife:
- I won the lottery.
There is also a new fur coat, a car and an apartment. One day, my wife brought two vacation packages and went to the sea with her husband. We arrived, my wife immediately went to sea and sat in the water for a very long time. Husband:
- Come out, you'll catch a cold in the lottery.
