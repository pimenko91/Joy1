Early morning. The bus pulls away from the stop, and a woman runs after it and screams:
- People, stop the bus, I'm late for work!
Compassionate passengers took pity on the woman, knocked on the driver and he stopped the bus. The woman came in and said contentedly:
- I managed it!
- So, citizens, we are preparing tickets for verification!
