A man wakes up in the morning, has a terrible hangover, opens his eyes, does not remember anything, has a headache, looks around, seems to be at home, looks at the bed on the bedside table, a hundred grams and a sandwich. Everything is tidy in the apartment, the son is doing his homework, there is a choice of food in the kitchen and a note from his wife:
- Dear, don't get bored, I'll try to come home early from work. Kiss.
A man approaches his son and asks:
- Son, what happened yesterday? What have I done again?
The son answers:
- Yes, yesterday you came home drunk and drooling and fell on the bed with your clothes on. Mom began to undress you and you yelled at her...
