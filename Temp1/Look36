After the wedding, the young and the mother-in-law are sitting at the table.
The husband introduces them to the prospect of a new life:
- We have all the money, I will manage it!
Wife:
- No, let me ....
Husband banging his fist on the table:
- I am the owner of the house!
- The mother-in-law does all the housework!
Mother-in-law:
- No, let me....
The husband slammed his fist on the table again:
- I repeat, I am the owner of the house!
- I'll take turns sleeping with you every other night!
Wife:
- No, let me ....
Mother-in-law:
- Daughter, you heard who is the boss in the house!
