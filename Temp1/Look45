A man is lying on the beach in Sochi, sunbathing. A beautiful girl is lying on a chaise longue very close by. Suddenly, one of the vacationers approaches the girl and says:
- $100, come with me!
The girl refused. The man is watching what is happening. The next one comes up and offers:
- $500 and we're going to my room!
The girl refuses again. The man is getting more and more interesting. Here comes the third one:
- $1000 and we'll sleep together!
The girl refuses again. The man asks her:
- Listen, why are you refusing? I could have cut down some money.
The girl asks the man:
- Who do you work for?
The man in response:
- I'm a tractor driver.
Girl:
- Just imagine, you come to the sea to relax, and there are only tractors, tractors, tractors around you...
