A man is dying. He called all his relatives and said:
- Brother, do you remember how they wanted to put you in jail for economic fraud? I'm the one who snitched on you.
- Sister, do you remember how you were called to the Lubyanka? I wrote this anonymous letter.
- And you, wife, do you remember how you were fired from your job under the article? I made an effort to do that too.
- Forgive me, if you can, and fulfill my last wish, hang me with my feet from the ceiling.
The man died, his relatives hang him from the ceiling by his legs. Suddenly the doorbell rings. They open it, a police squad bursts in:
- We received a statement at the department that the corpse is being bullied here!
