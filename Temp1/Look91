The teacher shows the children a portrait of Karl Marx and asks:
- Children, do you know who this is?
The children answer in chorus:
- This is Uncle Vasya, the janitor!
The teacher
- How is Uncle Vasya the janitor?
Children:
- See for yourself.
The teacher looks out the window and sees Uncle Vasya, the janitor, with a shaggy beard. After the lesson, the teacher turns to the janitor:
- Vasily, with this beard you look like Karl Marx. It's not good. Maybe you should shave off your beard?
Dvorni sighs:
- Let's say I shave off my beard, but what should I do with my brain?
