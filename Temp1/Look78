An ensign and 4 conscripts were sent to work from the military unit to help the collective farm. We finished the work, the ensign built the soldiers and counts:
- One, two, three, four. And there were five of us. Where is the fifth one? We are all looking for the fifth one at the same pace. They ran away!
It's been 10 minutes. The ensign has built soldiers again, again there is no one. After another formation, one soldier suggested:
- Comrade Ensign, you get in line, and I'll count. Considers:
- One, two, three, four, pointing at yourself, five. That's it!
The ensign approaches this soldier, gives him a strong cuff and says:
- So it means that we've been looking for you for half an hour!
