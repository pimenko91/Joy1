A boy with a burn was brought to the emergency room of the hospital. Worried parents are sitting in the waiting room of the emergency room. Doctor:
- What happened?
Boy:
- With a friend in the garage, gasoline was poured from a canister. It was dark there, you couldn't see anything. We lit a match, we wanted to see how much was left.
Doctor:
- Well, have you seen how much is left?...
the evil father shouts from the dressing room:
- Two fucking blocks have you seen!
