The little son comes up to his mother and mumbles:
- Mom, when you were not at home yesterday, a neighbor came to dad and dad kicked her in the ass...
Mom abruptly interrupts her son:
- Dad will come in the evening, you will have dinner and tell this story.
In the evening, the family is sitting at dinner and the mother says to her son:
- Tell me, son, what you saw yesterday!
The son gets up and begins:
- Mom, when you were not at home yesterday, Aunt Marina's neighbor came to dad and dad shoved in her ass what Uncle Sasha shoved in your mouth the day before yesterday.
