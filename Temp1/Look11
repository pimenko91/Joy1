At the New Year's matinee in kindergarten, Santa Claus costumes were not appreciated by everyone and one of the parents had to wear a Death suit.
A little boy is sitting near a Christmas tree and someone's parent in a Death suit with a black hood and a scythe approaches him. The frightened boy, slowly sliding down from the chair, timidly whispers:
- Santa Claus! I've been behaving well all year, doing everything my parents asked me to do. You have incorrect information about me!
A Parent in a Death Suit:
- Boy, stop talking, come on, stand on a chair and read a poem.
The boy is shaking all over, crawls onto a high chair and begins to read:
- Our Father! Who art in heaven...
