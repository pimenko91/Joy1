A man came to the doctor and complains about a man's inability. The doctor examined him and said:
"Only one experimental method will help you.
The man became interested:
- Which one?
Doctor:
- We will transplant the trunk of a young elephant to you!
The man agrees. The operation was performed, the trunk took root. After a while, the man came to the doctor again. Satisfied, he thanks me. The doctor asks:
- Is there any side effect?
The man says:
- So, it's nothing...
the doctor told him:
- But still?
The man answers:
- When I go into the kitchen, he steals sugar from the table!
