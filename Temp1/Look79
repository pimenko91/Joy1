There's a new flight attendant on board. The plane has gained altitude and the commander says to the co-pilot:
- Take control, I'll go probe the soil...
I came back in half an hour, he thinks out loud:
- Well, she's not like that, but my wife is better anyway.
The co-pilot also went to the stewardess. Is returning:
- Yes, Cap, you're right, your wife is better.
