A man is being tried for throwing a refrigerator out of a fourth-floor window, which fell and injured the leg of a man passing below. Judge:
- The accused, tell us how it was.
The accused:
- I returned early in the morning from a business trip, and at home my wife is pale, all twitchy. I rushed to the window, opened it and saw her lover in his underpants running away under the windows. I grab the refrigerator and throw it out the window right on his head. But, he missed and injured only his leg.
Judge:
- Victim, now your word.
The victim:
- Your Honor, I run every morning before work. That morning, I was running the usual way and suddenly a refrigerator was flying from above. By some miracle, I managed to dodge.
Judge:
- Invite a witness.
A man is led into the hall by the arms. He has a cast on his arms and legs. The witness begins the story:
- So I'm sitting in the refrigeratorâ€¦
