The man had a son who was a jerk. A man comes to his father and asks:
- Father, how can my wife and I raise a child so that he is smart, obedient, responsible?
Father teaches:
- A child must be loved and not just loved, but sincerely loved, it takes a lot of patience, kindness and, most importantly, to be a good example to him!
The guy asks:
"Is that all?"
The father answers:
- Well, of course, give n%pills more often for prevention!
