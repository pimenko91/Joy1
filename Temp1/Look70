The general comes to the barbershop, takes off his stubble, takes out a pistol, cocks it, puts it on the table next to it and says:
- If you cut even a little, I'll shoot you, and if you shave carefully, I'll pay you three times.
The hairdresser agreed and did everything in the best possible way.
The general pays what he promised and says:
- And you are brave if you agreed to my terms!
The hairdresser responds:
"My razor was closer to your throat than your hand was to your gun!"
