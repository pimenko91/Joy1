Nadezhda Krupskaya is walking along St. Petersburg and sees the pioneers marching in formation. She decided to ask if they knew who she was. Krupskaya approaches the pioneers and asks:
- Do you know who I am?
The children answer:
- Yes. You are Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya!
Krupskaya continues:
- Children, do you know who my husband is?
The pioneers started talking:
- Of course!
- Who won't take old Krupsky!
