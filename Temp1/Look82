A young lieutenant arrived at the squalid part and asked the senior employee there:
- How is it served here?
Starley says:
- As it should be! Every year there is a new title.
LIEUTENANT:
- Yes, okay? How long have you been here?
Starley:
- The fourth year.
Lieutenant:
- And only the older ones?
Starley:
- We've been playing recently. I came here as a colonel.
