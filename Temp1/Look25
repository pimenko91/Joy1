The child in the family is five years old, and he still does not speak. His parents brought him to the clinic and the doctor tells them:
- Don't worry, everything will be fine, he will talk, but only those who are named the first three times will die.
After a while, the child said the word grandfather. My grandfather died.
Soon he said baba. My grandmother died.
One day the wife says to her husband:
- Take a walk with the child, while I run to the store.
A child was walking, walking and Dad said.
They came home from a walk, the father washed himself, put on a new suit, shoes and lay down on the bed, waiting for him to go to another world. The wife comes home and tells her husband:
- You're lying on the bed in a new suit.
- Get up and let's go to the funeral, the neighbor died.
