At the English lesson, an inspector from RONO sat down at Vovochka's desk. The teacher addresses the class:
- I will write a sentence now, and you will translate it.
He starts writing a sentence and drops the chalk. Bending down and picking up the chalk, she finished the sentence and asks the students:
- Well, who is ready to answer?
Vovochka pulls out her hand, stands up and says:
- Oh, if only the skirt were shorter!
The teacher, outraged, expels Vovochka from the classroom. Vovochka puts the notebooks in a briefcase and says to the inspector:
- Asshole, you don't know, don't tell me!
