The employee returned from the vacation home and shows photos from the vacation at his place of work:
- This lady is with me, and this one with this, this one with that and this...
suddenly one of the employees sees his wife in the photo, who was in the same holiday home. He asks in an agitated voice:
"And who did this one spend time with?"
The arriving employee responds:
- Well, this one was the most decent. As she arrived with her husband, so she left with him.
