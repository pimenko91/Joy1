The wolf caught Little Red Riding Hood on the way to Grandma, dragged him into the bushes and grinned:
- Come on!
Little Red Riding Hood is scared:
- Wolf, are you that I'm not like that!
The wolf does not retreat:
- I repeat again, come on, or you'll regret it!
Little Red Riding Hood lifted her skirt, lowered her panties, and the wolf growled:
- Did I drag you here to take a shit? I say pies, come on!
