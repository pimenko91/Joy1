An elderly rabbi and a young man are traveling in the train compartment. Going to bed, the young man asks:
- Can you tell me what time it is?
The rabbi, without saying a word, turns to the wall and pours.
In the morning, the train arrives in Kharkov. Both passengers woke up and began to prepare to leave. The rabbi looked at his watch and said to the young man:
- A young man. You asked me yesterday what time it was? Now, it's half past eight.
The young man is surprised:
- Why didn't you tell me yesterday when I asked you?
The rabbi answers:
- You see, if I had answered yesterday what time it was, you would have asked me where I was going. I would answer that to Kharkov. You would have told me that you were also going to Kharkov and that you had nowhere to spend the night. As a kind person, I would invite you to my house. And I have a young daughter. You would have seduced her at night, for sure, and she would have gotten pregnant from you. You'd have to marry her.
The young man exclaimed:
- Well, what of it?
Rabbi:
- Why the hell do I need a son-in-law who doesn't even have a watch?
