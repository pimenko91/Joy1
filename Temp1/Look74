A sailor caught a goldfish, and she says to him:
"Let me go and I will fulfill your every wish!"
Sailor:
- No, it's better to fulfill the boatswain's first wish tomorrow.
Small fish:
- Well, so be it.
The boatswain wakes up in the morning, goes on deck and stretches and says:
- Oh, the weather, the anchor is in my ass!
