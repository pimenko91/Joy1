Prince Ivan went to look for happiness far away... He walked for three days and three nights and became thirsty. Ivan saw the well, went up to it and bent down to drink some water. Suddenly, a huge shadow appeared in front of him. Ivan turned around and saw the monster Serpent-Gorynych standing behind him. Ivan took out his sword and how let's chop off the heads of a fire-breathing bastard, but all to no avail. He cuts off one head, another grows up immediately! For three days and three nights the fight was fierce and Ivan could not stand it, fell to the trampled earth and spoke with the last of his strength:
- You beat me. Do what you want, I don't have the strength to fight you anymore.
Gorynych asks Ivan:
- Why did you come to the well?
Ivan:
- How about what? Drink some water!
Gorynych:
- Well, I would drink it! Who was bothering you?
