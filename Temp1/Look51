The wife goes on a business trip, the husband stays at home. The last instructions:
- That's it, I'm off, the food is in the fridge. Don't mess around with women!
A couple of days later, the husband calls his wife with a claim:
- Honey, you left and left an empty refrigerator! What to eat?
The wife replies:
- My love, there is plenty of food at home! I repeat. Don't go wandering around!
A week later, the wife returned from a business trip, and the husband did not calm down:
- You're a lousy hostess, you left me without food!
The wife takes her husband by the hand and leads him into the bedroom, tears off the bedspread, shows a mountain of rotten food and says:
- We need to spend the night at home, motherfucker!
