Husband and wife are sitting at home in the evening, watching TV. The doorbell rang and my wife went to answer it. A neighbor stands on the threshold and turns:
- Open your robe, and I'll give you $500 for it.
My wife thought, why not! She opened her robe. She received a reward and returned to her husband.
The husband asks:
- Who came?
Wife:
- The neighbor came to get salt.
Husband:
- I thought the neighbor. He promised to repay the $500 debt tonight.
