The furious wife of the chief engineer bursts into the office of the director of the plant and says:
"How long are you going to cover for my husband in everything?" Everyone knows that he is a womanizer. Yesterday he came home in women's underpants. And she threw her underpants on the table. The director tells her:
- Calm down. I don't have time now, but I'll figure it out tomorrow and take action. And you go, now I have a meeting to start. Employees come into the meeting, the director quickly took the underpants from the table and stuffed them into his pants pocket. The next morning, his wife began to shake off his trousers and his underpants fell out of his pocket. She screams:
- Darling, when will your stupid jokes end? I've been looking for these underpants for the second day, and they're in your pants!
