In the morning, the Snow Maiden asks Santa Claus:
- How were the children congratulated yesterday? I don't remember anything.
Santa Claus:
Yes, when you came to the last address, you were already very drunk. I drank a couple more glasses and let's do a striptease dance.
Snow Maiden:
- Oh, so that's where I got a pair of candy panties.
