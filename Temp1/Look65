A hairdresser girl cuts a guy's hair and asks him:
- Do you have a mother-in-law?
The guy tensely:
- I don't have a mother-in-law, no!
The hairdresser asks again:
- Do you have a mother-in-law?
The guy is worried again:
- Ugh, ugh, ugh, I don't have any mother-in-law!
The hairdresser again:
- Do you have a mother-in-law?
The guy got turned on:
- Well, I don't have a mother-in-law, why are you bothering, asking
for a bride?
- It's more convenient for me to cut your hair this way. I'm going to ask about your mother-in-law, your hair stands on end!
