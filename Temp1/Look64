Daddy gave Vovochka a mobile phone for her birthday. The next morning, Dad goes to work, says to Vovochka:
- Call me if you need anything.
A couple of hours later, Vovochka calls her father:
- Dad, the cat pooped in the living room again!
Dad answers:
- Vovochka, you are already an adult, take a broom, a rag and put it away!
At noon, Vovochka calls again:
- Dad, mom came with some uncle, they locked themselves in the bedroom. I peeked through the keyhole, the man takes off his pants... I'm definitely not going to clean up after him!
