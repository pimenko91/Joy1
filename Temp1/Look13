A monk and a nun ride through the desert on a camel. The camel fell down from the heat and died. The monk tells the nun:
- Imagine that we have gone to heaven.
The nun asks:
- How is that?
The monk answers:
- Let's get naked first.
Undress and the nun says:
"Oh my God, what is that between your legs?"
Monk:
- This is the root of life, I'll put it in for you now and you'll want to live.
The nun says:
- So put it in the camel, and let's go.
