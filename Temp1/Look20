Winnie the Pooh comes to visit Piglet and sees a carcass cutting scheme on his bedroom wall. Vinnie asks:
- What the hell is hanging on your wall?
Piglet answers:
- This is my portrait.
Vinnie asks again:
- Your portrait?
Piglet:
- This is the work of the artist Soutine Haim.
- Well, damn it, that's how he sees it!
