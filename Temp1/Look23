In a sex shop, a man chooses a gift for his fat wife. The seller advises:
- Take erotic lingerie, it's very sexy for a woman.
The man bought the underwear and the seller is interested:
- Can you take Viagra for the thrill?
The man answers:
- Uh, no! In order to look at it calmly, I'd rather buy corvalol!
