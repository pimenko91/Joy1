The director instructs the new secretary about the daily routine:
- From 8.00 to 9.00 I have RAM.
- From 9.00 to 10.00 I have a chief engineer.
- From 10.00 to 10.30 I have a chief accountant.
- From 10.30 to 11.00 meeting on urgent issues.
- From 11.00 to 12.00 signing of contracts and invoices.
- From 12.00 to 13.00 I have a sex hour.
The next day, at 11.55 a.m., his secretary comes into his office and begins to undress.
The boss did not understand much:
- And what are you doing?
His secretary:
- From 12.00 to 13.00 sexual hour, you said it yourself!
The boss said to her:
- Yes, I'm not in your office! I'm on the carpet at the ministry!
