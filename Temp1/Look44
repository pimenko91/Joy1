The woman at the psychoanalyst:
- Doctor, every date ends with a bed! I just can't refuse! And after that, I feel like such a fool and a whore, and it depresses me terribly!
Doctor:
- Okay, now I will put you in a trance, and when you come out of it, you will be able to refuse ...
a woman:
- Why refuse! Make sure I don't feel like a fool and a whore!
