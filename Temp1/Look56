A peasant came to the city to buy inventory and livestock for the farm. At the hardware store, I bought a bucket and an anvil, went to the market and bought a couple of chickens and a goose. He looks at everything he bought and thinks:
- How do you fix it all? But here's how. I'll put the anvil in a bucket, take it in one hand. I'll take a goose in my other hand and put chickens in my armpits.
On the way to the house, the peasant met a beautiful young girl. The girl tells him:
- I got lost, can you tell me how to get to the village of Mazyukino?
The peasant answers:
- I'm going to this village myself, follow me. We'll cut a couple of versts through the forest now, and then we'll be just around the corner.
The girl refuses:
- That won't do. I'm with you through the forest, you'll pin me to a tree and rape me.
Peasant:
- What are you, a beauty, how is this possible? I'm carrying a bucket with an anvil, two chickens and a goose, do I have all my hands full?
Girl:
- Everything is easy and simple, you fool! Put the goose on the ground, a bucket on top, an anvil on the bucket, and I'll hold the chickens!
